# Mean
Mean is the average value of the whole data - which also is the expectation of the data

Mean = Sum of the data / number of element in data.

Example: 

    n_num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
    
    n = len(n_num) 
    
    n_num.sort()

    mean = sum(n_num)/len(n_num)
	
    print("Mean is: " + str(mean))

Output:

    Mean is: 3
