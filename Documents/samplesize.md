#How to Find a Sample Size Given a Confidence Interval and Width (unknown population standard deviation)

Step 1: Using the data given in the question, figure out the following variables:

za/2: Divide the confidence interval by two, and look that area up in the z-table:
.95 / 2 = 0.475\
The closest z-score for 0.475 is 1.96.
E (margin of error):  Divide the given width by 2.
6% / 2
= 0.06 / 2
= 0.03\
then use the given percentage.  41% = 0.41. \
If you aren’t given that, use 50%.\
Then, subtract that from 1.\
1 – 0.41 = 0.59

Step 2:Multiplyphatbyqhat. Set this number aside for a moment.
0.41 × 0.59 =  0.2419

Step 3: Divide Za/2 by E.
1.96 / .03 = 65.3333333

Step 4: Square Step 3:
65.3333333 × 65.3333333 = 4268.44444

Step 5: Multiply Step 2 by Step 4:
0.2419 × 4268.44444 = 1,032.53671
= 1,033 people to survey.
