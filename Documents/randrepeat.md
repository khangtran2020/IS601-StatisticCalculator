#Set a seed and randomly select the same value from a list

random() function is used to generate random numbers in Python. Not actually random, rather this is used to generate pseudo-random numbers. That implies that these randomly generated numbers can be determined.

random() function generates numbers for some values. This value is also called seed value.

How Seed Function Works ?\
Seed function is used to save the state of a random function, so that it can generate same random numbers on multiple executions of the code on the same machine or on different machines (for a specific seed value). The seed value is the previous value number generated by the generator. For the first time when there is no previous value, it uses current system time.

Example:
    
    import random  
    for i in range(5): 
        random.seed(0)  
        print(random.randint(1, 1000))   
        
Output:

    865
    865
    865
    865
    865
