#Confidence Interval For a Sample

As it sounds, the confidence interval is a range of values. In the ideal condition, it should contain the best estimate of a statistical parameter. It is expressed as a percentage. 95% confidence interval is the most common. You can use other values like 97%, 90%, 75%, or even 99% confidence interval if your research demands. Let’s understand it by an example:
Here is a statement:
“In a sample of 659 parents with toddlers, about 85%, stated they use a car seat for all travel with their toddler. From these results, a 95% confidence interval was provided, going from about 82.3% up to 87.7%.”
This statement means, we are 95% certain that the population proportion who use a car seat for all travel with their toddler will fall between 82.3% and 87.7%. If we take a different sample or a subsample of these 659 people, 95% of the time, the percentage of the population who use a car seat in all travel with their toddlers will be in between 82.3% and 87.7%.

The calculation of the confidence interval 
involves the best estimate which is obtained 
by the sample and a margin of error. 
So, we take the best estimate and add a margin of 
error to it. Here is the formula for the confidence 
interval and the margin of error:
